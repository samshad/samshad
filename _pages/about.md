**Turning Complex Data Science into Production-Grade Software.**

I am a Solutions Engineer with a dual background in **Applied Statistics** and **Computer Science**. My expertise lies in the "messy middle" of modern tech: taking a theoretical model or a raw business need and engineering a robust, scalable, and cost-effective production system around it.

Whether it's fine-tuning Llama 3 on a budget or architecting an event-driven AWS backend that scales to zero, I build software that solves business problems.

## 🚀 Featured Engineering

### [01. AI-Powered Mindful Eating Companion](/portfolio/1-mindful-eating-app/)
*Generative AI & Mobile Engineering*

**The Challenge:** Generic health apps lack context. I needed a system that could "read" user personality and adapt its advice dynamically.
* **The Engineering:** Fine-tuned two **Meta Llama 3.2 (3B)** models using LoRA adapters. Built a proprietary dataset of 1,500 expert-verified tips to ensure clinical safety.
* **The Impact:** Achieved **~88% relevance** in user-rated pilot tests, running effectively on consumer-grade hardware.

### [02. SecureTask: Serverless Identity Verification](/portfolio/4-SecureTask/)
*Cloud Architecture & Security*

**The Challenge:** Building a secure biometric task platform without the operational overhead and cost of managing GPU servers.
* **The Engineering:** Architected a fully serverless AWS stack. Integrated **Rekognition** for face-ID (Selfie vs. ID) and used **CloudFormation** to deploy the infrastructure in <5 minutes.
* **The Impact:** **Reduced infrastructure costs by ~40%** compared to legacy containerized solutions.

### [03. Public Tenders Intelligence Dashboard](/portfolio/2-public-tenders-dashboard/)
*Data Engineering & Visual Analytics*

**The Challenge:** Procurement analysts were losing hours manually digging through 10 years of unstructured government tender data.
* **The Engineering:** Built an automated ETL pipeline to clean data noise by **35%** and applied **BERTopic (NLP)** to surface hidden spending trends automatically.
* **The Impact:** Accelerated trend identification speed by **30%**, transforming raw CSVs into strategic intelligence.

## 🧩 Off the Clock

My downtime usually looks a lot like my work: analyzing systems. Whether I'm optimizing character builds in an RPG or dissecting the plot structure of a slow-burn thriller, I enjoy figuring out how things work.

* **Gaming & Cinema:** I’m drawn to deep lore and complex mechanics. Favorites include *The Witcher 3* and *Better Call Saul*.
* **Background Process:** Powered almost entirely by black coffee.
