By trade, I'm an **MSc Applied Computer Science grad from Dalhousie University**, architecting robust backend systems and diving deep into the world of AI and Large Language Models. By passion, I'm a connoisseur of compelling narratives (in games, movies, or even well-structured data), a seeker of that perfect indie track, and a firm believer that most problems can be improved with good coffee and a quiet moment by the ocean.

### The Off-Duty Algorithm (aka What Fuels Me)

When I'm not wrangling code or deciphering data patterns, you'll likely find me:

*   🎮 **Lost in Narrative-Rich Games:** If there's a branching storyline, a hidden lore document, or a moral quandary, I'm there. I've been known to mentally (and sometimes literally) plot-diagram character arcs. It’s all about understanding complex systems, right?
*   🎬 **Deconstructing Movies & Shows:** I'm the person who stays for the end-credits and then wants to discuss the foreshadowing. Analyzing a good plot twist feels surprisingly similar to debugging a tricky piece of logic.
*   🎧 **Powered by Indie Anthems:** My coding sessions (and life in general) are often scored by a carefully curated playlist of indie music. There’s something about those unique vocals and unexpected synth lines that just clicks with problem-solving.
*   ☕ **Fueled by Unrelenting Espresso:** You could say my bloodstream has a baseline espresso level. My coffee ritual is an hourly punctuation mark, a moment to reset and refocus before diving back into the digital deep end. No frills, just the pure, unadulterated essence of 'LIFE'."
*   🌊 **Midnight Ocean Contemplations:** The ocean at night is my silent collaborator. It doesn't offer answers directly, but its steady presence and the sheer scale of it create a mental space where answers can find me. It's a pilgrimage I make when I need to trade the glow of the monitor for the glow of the moon on the water, and digital complexity for elemental simplicity.

### Let's Connect!

I genuinely love connecting with new people, hearing about their journeys, what they're passionate about, and what problems they're trying to solve – whether it's in tech, art, or just life. Every conversation is a chance to learn something new, and I'm all ears.
