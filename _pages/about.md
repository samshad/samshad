**I am an AI & Backend Solutions Engineer with a dual background in Applied Statistics and Computer Science.**

I don't just build models; I deploy them. My focus is on architecting production-grade systems, from fine-tuning LLMs for specialized tasks to building serverless AWS backends that scale effortlessly.

## The Tech Stack

* **Artificial Intelligence:** LLM Fine-Tuning (Llama 3.2, LoRA, UnslothAI), NLP (spaCy, BERTopic), AWS Rekognition.
* **Backend Engineering:** Python (FastAPI, Django), RESTful APIs, Microservices.
* **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, ECS, S3), Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD.
* **Data Science:** PostgreSQL, ETL Pipelines, Dash/Plotly Visualization.

## Featured Engineering

### 01. AI-Powered Mindful Eating App (Capstone)
*Full-Stack AI Application | React Native, FastAPI, Llama 3.2, PostgreSQL*

**The Challenge:** Generic AI advice wasn't enough. I needed a system that could understand user personality traits and deliver hyper-personalized dietary guidance on edge devices.
* **The Solution:** Fine-tuned two **Meta Llama 3.2 (3B)** models using LoRA/Unsloth. Curated a dataset of 1,500 expert-verified tips mapped to Big-5 personality traits.
* **The Impact:** Achieved **~88% relevance** in user-rated pilot tests.

### 02. SecureTask: Serverless Identity Verification
*Cloud Architecture | AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Rekognition, CloudFormation*

**The Challenge:** Building a task management system that required military-grade identity verification without the overhead of managing servers.
* **The Solution:** Architected a fully serverless backend. Implemented **Face-ID verification** (Selfie vs. ID Card) with >80% accuracy using AWS Rekognition.
* **The Impact:** Slashed infrastructure costs by **~40%** compared to containerized alternatives.

### 03. Public Tenders Intelligence Dashboard
*Data Science & NLP | Python Dash, Plotly, BERTopic, Docker*

**The Challenge:** Procurement analysts were drowning in 10 years of messy, unstructured tender data.
* **The Solution:** Engineered automated ETL pipelines to clean data noise by **35%**. Applied **BERTopic** to automatically extract shifting procurement trends over a decade.
* **The Impact:** Increased trend identification speed by **30%**.

## Beyond the Code

I believe the most elegant technology mirrors a beautifully crafted narrative. My approach to engineering is grounded in the same curiosity that drives me to deconstruct complex plots in cinema or optimize strategies in gaming.

* **Narrative Analysis:** Whether it's the moral complexities of *The Witcher 3* or the foreshadowing in *Better Call Saul*, I treat storytelling like code, looking for the underlying logic that makes it work.
* **Unrelenting Black Coffee:** My day is punctuated by 7-8 cups of Americano. It’s my system reboot.
* **The Ocean's Rhythm:** When the digital complexity gets too loud, I find clarity in the elemental simplicity of the Atlantic ocean at night.
